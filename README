It's early in the morning and your alarm clock wakes you up. Unfortunately
you don't remember where you put the alarm clock, so you have to run
through your house to find it and shut if off. Listen to the sound wave
which comes from the alarm clock. It will help you to find it, because
the sound get lauder when you get closer.
