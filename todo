    ✓ game name
    - assets
        ✓ create map images
        - create character images

    ✓ sound
        ✓ play sound from clock (loudness proportional to distance from the clock)
    - screens
        - (re)start screen
        - winning screen

stretch goals:
    - time based events e.g. noon: "you should eat!"; if it is dark outside, the same in the game
    - if it's dark outside, you see less but it's quiet
    - fade in the circle where you see something
    - if there is daylight, you see more, but there is also some noise
    - weather api (if it rains outside play rain sound)
    - map size defined by game size

finalizing:
    - remove all non license compliant parts (phaser -> link, music?)
